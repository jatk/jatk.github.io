I use protein engineering and synthetic biology approaches to study and control bioenergetic processes in bacteria. Specifically, I am fascinated by electron transport and energy conservation in bacterial metabolism. My postdoctoral work is focusing on building synthetic mimics of cable bacteria to study how multicellular communities can evolve to couple distinct metabolic reactions using long-distance electron transfer.

Before USC, I did my Ph.D. in <a href="https://sspb.rice.edu/">Systems, Synthetic, and Physical Biology</a> at Rice University in Houston, TX. There I worked in <a href="https://www.silberglab.org/">Jonathan Silberg's lab</a> building ligand-gated protein switches to control electron transfer to control sulfur assimilation in <i>Escherichia coli</i>. I did part of my Ph.D. at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley, CA where I collaborated with <a href = "http://cafgroup.rice.edu/"> Caroline Ajo-Franklin </a> at the Molecular Foundry. We designed strains of <i>E. coli</i>  that could perform extracellular electron transfer to reduced electrodes and used the ligand-gated protein switches to control current production.  We used these living electronic sensors for real-time reporting on the presence of chemicals in marine and riverine water samples.
