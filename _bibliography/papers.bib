            Real-time chemical sensing is needed to counter the global threats posed by pollution. We combine synthetic biology and materials engineering to develop a living bioelectronic sensor platform with minute detection times.
            Escherichia coli
            was programmed to reduce an electrode in a chemical-dependent manner using a modular, eight-component, synthetic electron transport chain. This strain produced significantly more current upon exposure to thiosulfate, an anion that causes microbial blooms. Incorporating a protein switch into the synthetic pathway and encapsulation of microbes with electrodes and conductive nanomaterials yielded a living bioelectronic sensor that could detect an endocrine disruptor within two minutes in riverine water, implicating the signal as mass transfer limited. These findings provide a new platform for miniature, low-power sensors that safeguard ecological and human health.

			Recombination can be used in the laboratory to overcome component limitations in synthetic biology by creating enzymes that exhibit distinct activities and stabilities from native proteins. To investigate how recombination affects the properties of an oxidoreductase that transfers electrons in cells, we created ferredoxin (Fd) chimeras by recombining distantly related cyanobacterial and cyanomyophage Fds (53% identity) that present similar midpoint potentials but distinct thermostabilities. Fd chimeras having a wide range of amino acid substitutions retained the ability to coordinate an iron–sulfur cluster, although their thermostabilities varied with the fraction of residues inherited from each parent. The midpoint potentials of chimeric Fds also varied. However, all of the synthetic Fds exhibited midpoint potentials outside of the parental protein range. Each of the chimeric Fds could also support electron transfer between Fd-NADP reductase and sulfite reductase in Escherichia coli, although the chimeric Fds varied in the expression required for similar levels of cellular electron transfer. These results show how Fds can be diversified through recombination and reveal differences in the inheritance of thermostability and electrochemical properties. Furthermore, they illustrate how electron transfer efficiencies of chimeric Fds can be rapidly evaluated using a synthetic metabolic pathway.

			Monitoring microbial reactions in highly opaque or autofluorescent environments like soils, seawater, and wastewater remains challenging. To develop a simple approach for observing post-translational reactions within microbes situated in environmental matrices, we designed a methyl halide transferase (MHT) fragment complementation assay that reports by synthesizing an indicator gas. We show that backbone fission within regions of high sequence variability in the Rossmann domain yields split MHT (sMHT) AND gates whose fragments cooperatively associate to synthesize CH3Br. Additionally, we identify a sMHT whose fragments require fusion to pairs of interacting partner proteins for maximal activity. We also show that sMHT fragments fused to FKBP12 and the FKBP-rapamycin binding domain of mTOR display significantly enhanced CH3Br production in the presence of rapamycin. This gas production is reversed in the presence of the competitive inhibitor of FKBP12/FKPB dimerization, indicating that sMHT is a reversible reporter of post-translational reactions. This sMHT represents the first genetic AND gate that reports on protein–protein interactions via an indicator gas. Because indicator gases can be measured in the headspaces of complex environmental samples, this assay should be useful for monitoring the dynamics of diverse molecular interactions within microbes situated in hard-to-image marine and terrestrial matrices.

	abstract = {
            Adenylate kinase (AK) orthologs with a range of thermostabilities were subjected to random circular permutation, and deep mutational scanning was used to evaluate where new protein termini were nondisruptive to activity. The fraction of circularly permuted variants that retained function in each library correlated with AK thermostability. In addition, analysis of the positional tolerance to new termini, which increase local conformational flexibility, showed that bonds were either functionally sensitive to cleavage across all homologs, differentially sensitive, or uniformly tolerant. The mobile AMP-binding domain, which displays the highest calculated contact energies, presented the greatest tolerance to new termini across all AKs. In contrast, retention of function in the lid and core domains was more dependent upon AK melting temperature. These results show that family permutation profiling identifies primary structure that has been selected by evolution for dynamics that are critical to activity within an enzyme family. These findings also illustrate how deep mutational scanning can be applied to protein homologs in parallel to differentiate how topology, stability, and local energetics govern mutational tolerance.},
